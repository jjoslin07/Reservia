## Scenario
Finally, you’ve found your first internship as a web developer at Reservia, a small company offering a vacation planning tool. Their site allows users to find accommodations and activities in the city of their choice. Accommodations can also be filtered by theme, for example, their budget or their atmosphere.

Loic, the UI designer, has proposed a new design based on the principles of Material Design.

Before finalizing this design, the company has decided to make a prototype. The first step is to integrate the responsive mock-up in HTML and CSS. Loïc has sent you the following email, with your manager, Sarah, CCed:

Subject : Reservia mock-up integration

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello! 

I'm sending you the new desktop and mobile mock-ups of the Reservia website. The folder also includes the images. Here are some details that will be useful for integration.

### Features

- Users will be able to search for accommodations in the city of their choice. Therefore, the search field is an input field, the text of which can be edited by the user. However, at this stage, the search button will not be functional.
- Each accommodation or activity card will have to be clickable in its entirety. For the moment, the links will be empty.
- The filters will not be functional for this version; however, they must change their appearance when hovered over. I leave it up to you to decide the most appropriate effect.
- In the menu, the Accommodations and Activities links are anchors that should lead to sections of the page.
 
 ### Technical constraints

- I’m providing you with two mock-ups: one desktop and one mobile. The site will also have to be adapted for tablets. You are free to make the necessary adaptations with the layout, as long as no elements are cut, and the text is a sufficient size. I’ll let you choose the appropriate breakpoints.
- As I didn't know which image sizes and formats you need, I exported a variety. I’ll let you choose the most suitable format concerning resolution and loading time.
- The icons come from the [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/). The colors of the chart are blue #0065FC and its lighter version #DEEBFF, as well as grey for the background #F2F2F2.
- The site font is [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway).
 

If you have any questions, do not hesitate to write to me.

Have a nice day!

You immerse yourself in the project and start asking yourself some technical questions about integration. Luckily, your manager follows up with an email to give you more details!

Subject : RE - Reservia mock-up integration

Hello,

I hope that the first elements shared by Loïc are clear to you! As this is your first project with us and you're interning, I wanted to give you a little more guidance:

- Don't use a framework or a pre-compiler for this project (like SASS for instance): since you are just starting out, I prefer that  you sharpen your skills using HTML and CSS and learn to code from scratch. We want to test your skills on that!
- I recommend using Visual Studio Code. The plugins can make your life easier (for example, Live Server or Prettier).
- You can integrate Font Awesome icons in HTML or CSS. I strongly advise you to use Flexbox, but you can also use CSS Grid if you want.
- Your code will have to use semantic tags and not contain any errors or warnings when running it through the W3C HTML and CSS validator.
- The site should be compatible with the latest versions of Chrome and Firefox.
- Remember to separate HTML and CSS and to organize your folders accordingly.
- Don't forget to version your code with Git from the beginning! It will help your team track your work. We use GitKraken as a Git client, it's nicer than the command line, but you can you use whatever you want. And then you need to deploy the page on GitHub Pages or GitLab Pages (your choice which one).
 

Have a great day! 

Sarah

CTO


## Deliverables
- A link to your GitHub or GitLab repository and include: 
  - The code versioned on GitHub or GitLab.
  - A link to your web page hosted online on GitHub Pages or GitLab Pages in the README.

Your deliverable must be named using the following convention: Fullname_#_StartDate_A The # refers to the number of the project on the path. The start date should be in the mmddyyyy format. If you have multiple deliverables, change the letter at the end (ex. “A” for the first deliverable, “B” for the second deliverable, etc.). All deliverables must be publicly accessible.

## Project Presentation 

The presentation will be structured as follows, with the assessor playing Sarah:

- Presentation and explanation of deliverables (10 minutes)
- Discussion (15 min)
  - The assessor will ask you questions about your methodology and your deliverables.
  - Be prepared to defend your work, as the assessor will challenge your decisions.

The assessor will stop playing the role of Sarah five minutes before the end of the session to debrief together.
